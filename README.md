## 👋 Hello

I'm **Miguelangel Rojas**, a Full-Stack Developer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, secure, and maintainable software across web and mobile environments. I work with modern JavaScript ecosystems — primarily **TypeScript, React, Angular, Node.js, and .NET** — and I enjoy solving real problems through architecture, automation, and clean engineering.

Originally from Venezuela, currently based in Argentina.
